**SSH - Secure Shell Protocol**

A cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network. Most commonly used for secure access to remotemachines. It uses encryption mechanisms to ensure that malicious actors wonâ€™t understand the message even if they have access to the entire data stream.

SSH uses public-private key cryptography to authenticate a remote connection and a user if necessary.

**Port**

A connection endpoint uniquely identified by a number. It directs data toa specific service.

## Solution

```

    # connect to the remote machine via ssh
    ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

    # next we decided to look at directory contents
    ls

    # found a file called readme so we looked at its contents
    cat readme

```
